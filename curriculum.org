** French
  + aim for 2 exercises/day
  + find some french news to watch
  + look for french podcast
  + read sartre/ others
  + translate/write
  
* Physics - Undergrad
  + check out phys forum link if any of these are too pricey
  + take notes with latex - or even just copying examples
    + link them to this file but only after getting latex preview to work in org - not as a copout
    + http://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.html

*** TODO Chapter 2 :: Differentiation
**** 2.1 Derivative, tangent line
***** Definition of derivative  
      \[
      f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
      \]
**** 2.2 Basic Derivative Rules
      \[
      \frac{d}{dx}[sin x] = cos x
      \]
      \[
      \frac{d}{dx}[cos x] = sin x
      \]
**** 2.3 Product and Quotient
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx} vu = u'v + v'u
     \]
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx} \left[\frac{u}{v}\right] = \frac{u'v - v'u}{v^2}
     \]
**** 2.4 Chain Rule 
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[f(u)] = f'(u)u'
     \]
**** 2.5 Implicit Differentiation
***** Chain rule with d/dx as placeholder for actual derivative
**** 2.6 Related Rates
***** Differentiation with respect to time 
**** DONE Problem set ch 2 (maybe use that ruby problem set generator? - there are a lot here)

*** TODO Chapter 3 :: Applications of Differentiation
*** 4-9
  
** TODO University Physics - Mechanics (Physics I)[0%]
  + this should be quick but do not rush
*** TODO Chapter 1 :: Units, Vector
**** 1.10 Products of Vectors 
***** Dot Product (Scalar Product) 
     \[
     \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{A}}}\cdot\overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{B}}} = \textit{AB}\cos\phi = |\overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{A}}}||\overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{B}}}|\cos\phi
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{A}}}\cdot\overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{B}}} =A_{x}B_{x} + A_{y}B_{y} +A_{z}B_{z}
     \]
***** Cross Product ( Vector Product)
     - Perpendicular to plane of components (right hand rule)
     - C = 0 when A and B are parallel or antiparallel
       
      \[
      C = AB\sin\phi
      \] (Magnitude of cross product of \[ \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{A}}} \] and \[ \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{B}}} \] )  
     - add below verbose form
      \[
      \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{A}}} \times \overrightarrow{\textit{\textbf{B}}} = \left| \begin{array}{ccc} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ A_{x} & A_{y} & A_{z} \\ B_{x} & B_{y} & B_{z} \end{array} \right|
