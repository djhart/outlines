** Spanish
  + aim for 2 exercises/day
  + pomo with harry potter too, really understand though dont just skim
  + duolingo
  + write
  
** French
  + aim for 2 exercises/day
  + find some french news to watch
  + look for french podcast
  + read sartre/ others
  + translate/write
  
* Physics - Undergrad
  + check out phys forum link if any of these are too pricey
  + take notes with latex - or even just copying examples
    + link them to this file but only after getting latex preview to work in org - not as a copout
    + http://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.html

*** do at least all the reds
*** Chapter 2 :: Differentiation
**** do some notes here - use latex
*** 3-9
  
** Intro Phys - see amazon cart - freeman - or link 2 
  + this should be quick but do not rush
  
** Intro 2
  + have this one, same as above dont rush, foundational
  + also that other book might have this info
  
** Engineering math - see amazon

** Vibrations/waves - see amazon

** Phys IV book
  + slow, really understand
  + did not do well here before 
  
** Taylor Mechanics
  + expensive, use pdf
  + do alongside Phys IV
  + see amazon/top links for supplements/ prob sets
  + do a lot of problems - maybe all
  + this is bread and butter - prob most core
  
** vector calc
  + do with above, if not sooner
  + very important

** Griffiths e&m
  + do all probs

** Griffiths Quantum
  + do all probs
  
** Thermodynamics
  + you have a book at home to do - not sure on quality
  + amazon cart has a thermo book too - pretty cheap
  
** Extra bits
  + Astronomy - amazon cart
  + Astrophys - amazon cart - pricey
  + cosmo - amazon cart - get early for bry
  + electronics - amazon cart, check out the pedal thing brandon was doing, sautering iron needed
  + particle phys - amazon cart, expensive - check out the link first
  
* Physics - Grad

** Math methods
  + Arfken - welcome to hell
    + do it this time
    + really understand
  + complex analysis, group theory, fourier series - see amazon for all, some pricey but this is way down the road
  
** Electrodynamics
  + Jackson of course
  
** Quantum mechanics
  + Sakurai - amzon cart - very expensive
  + Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals by Feynman - cheap on amazon
  + Shankar - amazon - pricey
  + Decoherence and the Appearance of a Classical World in Quantum Theory - amazon - pricey
  + Dirac Principles of QM - relatively cheap - written by Dirac so get
